## Authentication in the API

The API provides multiple authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to its resources.

### Token Authentication

You can obtain an access token by using the dedicated `auth` endpoint. This token is required for accessing protected endpoints and offers enhanced security.

### API Key Authentication

Alternatively, you can use the development API key `dev-api-key` for authentication. This is a quick way to get started and is suitable for testing purposes.

To authenticate using the API key, simply include it in the appropriate headers of your requests.
